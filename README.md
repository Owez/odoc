# ODoc

## Usage

Coming soon.

## Showcase

Coming soon.

## Why?

### Formatting

I want to use markdown for productivity when creating essays which have to be exported to docx. I also want these exported docx files to look as professional and as well-presented as possible. The format is docx for two main reasons:

1. They're required for what I'm doing
2. They're very well-supported for format conversions (e.g. PDF, EPUB)

I'd rather directly export to something like PDF but it's less editable, convertible, and would be harder to develop for.

### Settings

As for settings, there are none. This project purposefully has no export settings as every valid markdown input should result in a heavily opinionated and *good looking* docx file.
